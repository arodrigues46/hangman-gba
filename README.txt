Hangman

Purpose of the Game:

- One user can enter a word at the beginning (not more than 15 characters or there will be tearing).
- Press enter and another user can start guessing letters to figure out the word/words.
- If the user gets all the right letters, they are sent to the win page.
- Each time the user selects an incorrect letter, that letter is blocked off and another limb is drawn on the hangman.
- If the user gets 6 letters wrong, they lose. The body parts are drawn in the following order: head, body, left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm.
